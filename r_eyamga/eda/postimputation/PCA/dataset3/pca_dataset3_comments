Dataset 3 
Contains the dataset filtered by selecting only  the most important variables based on the PCA on dataset1

Continuous only
- Labs and Vital Signs
* Eigen Values of 10 PCs - 46% (vs 43% when all together)


- Labs Only
* Eigen Values of 10 PCs - 56% (vs 43% when all together)

- VS Only
* Eigen Values of 4PCs - 72% 

Categorical only
- All categorical
* Eigen Values of 10 PCs (none above 1) and 15% of variance 
SO BAD that I did not even record it
* At the same time, it might simply be affected by the missing data
I did not even copy the results in the data 

- Filtered categorical
* Eigen Values of 10 PCs and 50% variances

- Filtered categorical AND simplified data (0 or 1)
* Eigen Values of 10 PCs and 80% variances

Really interesting
This one seems to really capture some information in the dataset
No further removal for now
Next step :update drug_dict + see how the data performs on 72h set and with only reduced candidate
